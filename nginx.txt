Nginx (pronounced "engine x"[9] /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS, stylized as NGINX or nginx) is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Russian developer Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004.[10] Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use Nginx,[11] often as a load balancer.[12]

What is NGINX?
NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server that also works as:

Load balancer

HTTP cache

Mail proxy

Originally designed to handle high concurrency with low memory usage, it’s widely used for serving websites, APIs, and apps due to its speed and efficiency.

Why Use NGINX?
✅ Lightweight and Fast

✅ Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections

✅ Open-source and actively maintained

✅ Used by top sites (Netflix, Dropbox, GitHub)

Nginx may be configured to serve static web content or to act as a proxy server.[21]

Nginx can be deployed to also serve dynamic content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and can serve as a software load balancer.[22][21]

Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests.[23] Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide predictable performance under high loads.

What is Caching in NGINX?
Caching in NGINX refers to storing a copy of a response (like an HTML page or API result) so that the next time someone asks for the same resource, NGINX can deliver it faster without contacting the backend server again.
⚡ Why Use Caching?
✅ Improves speed and user experience

✅ Reduces load on backend servers

✅ ✅ Saves bandwidth and system resources

Types of Caching in NGINX
Static File Caching (by browser):

You set headers to tell the browser to cache static files (images, CSS, JS).

Proxy Caching (by NGINX):

NGINX caches content from an upstream server (like a Node.js/PHP API).
